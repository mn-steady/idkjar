This is a website with a Jar that my fiancee clicks everytime I say IDK and it transfers $1 SILK from my wallet to her hers. She wanted a real Jar but I told her I dont every carry real money so this is the only thing that would work. It would be locked down to certain addresses and could even build in an audit VK but I dont want to be accused of money laundering so I scrapped the project. 

Turns out i actually carry cash in Colombia, so I got her a real jar! 😂

Maybe I can setup a webcam of the jar so we can all watch it fill up? 🤔

Sara says I cant trick her with this, because she cant use Pesos in America. So I guess we need 2 jars, or 1 real jar and a virtual idkjar.com 🤣

The physical jar has a new income source, I forot that when you use a Debit Card at the dispensary they give you back a few dollar bills to even out the transaction. 💸 She will be happy when I go now 🤣
