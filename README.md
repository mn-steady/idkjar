This is a website with a Jar that my fiance clicks everytime I say IDK and it transfers $1 SILK from my wallet to her hers. She wanted a real Jar but I told her I dont every carry real money so this is the only thing that would work. It would be locked down to certain addresses and could even build in an audit VK but I dont want to be accused of money laundering so I scrapped the project. 

Turns out i actually carry cash in Colombia, so I got her a real jar! 😂
